# Social-networking-platform

Inspired by large Social networking sites, I thought of designing my own social networking site with functionality that I think
current social sites miss. 

Features:

1) User can create account and login.
2) Password changing feature is available in case user forgots password
3) User can update status and the status will be aligned in chronogical order
4) User can change its info, profile pic.
5) User can find other users and also like their post and follow them.
6) Routing is done to hide the file extension in url

More features are in development.
